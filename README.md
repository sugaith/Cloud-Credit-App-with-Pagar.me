Cloud Credit App with Pagar.me


I used nodify lib to "nodify" the pagar.me lib for React Native. For this, the package.json became huge.

This is just an example on how to use pagarme lib with client side, but the pagarm.me lib lets you performe the whole operation o server-side also.

Any Q. just ask
